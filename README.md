# README

This project is mostly meant for me so this file holds notes.

## Things I should be googling:

- grice's maxim I think this will be a good set of rules to follow.


## Things I should be thinking about:

- speakers meaning vs audience meaning (as a measure of accuracy for the ais)

## Philosophy of this application:

I am going to try to study as much psychology as possible and try to mimic all of the
ideas in psychology using analogous datatypes.

So one psychological idea, which comes from sci fi not necessarily actual psychology
is the personality trait chart from westworld, where each character had a list of some
personality traits with a score or a scale associated with each, and sub personality
traits contained within each.  Each of these traits will define how a character will
act in certain situations.

The highest level traits in the show are:
Bulk Apperception
Candor
Vivacity
Coordination
Meekness
Humility
Cruelty
Self Preservation
Patience
Dicisiveness
Imagination
Curiosity
Aggression
Loyalty
Empathy
Tenacity
Courage
Sensuality
Charm
Humor

How each of these are used to define the action a character takes is not delved apon
in the show.  I intend to supply these as global values that the code can referenc
in order to pick an action.  At the moment I plan on hard-coding these
reactions and their necessary personality traits but in the future I plan on
allowing the traits to be modified my the character or internal forces within the
character.
